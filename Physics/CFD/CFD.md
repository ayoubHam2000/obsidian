## What is CFD

- CFD is numerically solving an equation or set of equations that govern fluid motion.
- CFD involves multiple complicated steps that have been developed over many decades by mathematicians, engineers, physicists, computer, scientists, etc.

- Discretized forms of the PDE must be solved at discrete points called grid points.
- These grid points must conform (but not necessarily) to the domain and boundary conditions.
