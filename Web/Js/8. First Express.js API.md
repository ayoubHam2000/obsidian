## Express

Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime. It provides a set of features and tools for building web applications, APIs, and microservices. Express is known for its minimalist and flexible design, which allows developers to create web applications with ease and simplicity.

Express provides a number of features, including:

-   Middleware: Express supports middleware, which are functions that can be chained together to process HTTP requests and responses. Middleware can be used for tasks such as parsing request bodies, handling authentication, and logging requests.
-   Routing: Express provides a simple and flexible routing mechanism for defining routes and handling HTTP requests. Routes can be defined based on HTTP methods and URL patterns.
-   Templating engines: Express can work with a variety of templating engines such as EJS, Pug, and Handlebars, allowing developers to render dynamic HTML pages based on data.
-   Error handling: Express provides a robust error handling mechanism for handling errors and exceptions that occur during request processing.
-   Static file serving: Express can serve static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from the file system, making it easy to build web applications with client-side components.
-   Third-party middleware: Express has a large ecosystem of third-party middleware that can be easily integrated into an application.


## Middleware

In Express, middleware is a function or a set of functions that are invoked before the final request handler function. Middleware functions can access and modify the request and response objects, and can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, error handling, and so on.

Middleware functions in Express are defined using the `app.use()` method, which takes one or more functions as arguments. These functions are executed in the order they are defined, and each function has access to the `request`, `response`, and `next` objects.

Here is an example of a simple middleware function that logs the HTTP method and URL of each incoming request:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const start = Date.now()
    console.log("Middleware")
    //before
    next()
    //after
    const end = Date.now()
    const diff = end - start
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url} ${diff}ms`)
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});

```

## Model View Controller

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.![[2560px-MVC-Process.svg.png]]
