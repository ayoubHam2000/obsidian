## HTTP

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol that defines how clients and servers communicate over the World Wide Web. It is a request-response protocol, which means that clients send requests to servers, and servers respond with messages containing the requested resources, such as HTML pages, images, or data.

The HTTP protocol operates over the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data. HTTP uses a request/response model in which clients send requests to servers, and servers respond with messages containing the requested resources.

HTTP requests consist of several parts, including:

-   A request line, which includes the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST), the requested URL, and the HTTP version.
-   Headers, which provide additional information about the request, such as the type of data the client can accept, the encoding used, and authentication credentials.
-   An optional message body, which can contain data that the client wants to send to the server.

HTTP responses also consist of several parts, including:

-   A status line, which includes the HTTP version, a status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), and a status message.
-   Headers, which provide additional information about the response, such as the type of data being sent, caching information, and authentication credentials.
-   An optional message body, which contains the requested resource or an error message.

HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that each request and response is independent and unrelated to any previous or future requests or responses. However, web applications often use cookies or other mechanisms to maintain state across multiple requests.

HTTP is widely used for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it is also used for other types of data transfer. For example, many web APIs use HTTP to send and receive data in a structured format such as JSON or XML.

```js
const http = require('http')

const PORT = 3000

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.writeHead(200, {
        "Content-Type": "text/plain"
    })
    res.end("Hi!")
})

server.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Listen On Port ${PORT}`)
})
```

## Origin

In web security, an origin is the combination of the scheme (protocol), domain, and port of a web page or web application. An origin represents the set of web resources (e.g. documents, images, scripts, and so on) that share the same security context and are subject to the same security restrictions.

The origin is determined by the following parts of a URL:

-   Scheme: This refers to the protocol used to communicate with the server, such as "http" or "https".
-   Domain: This refers to the host name of the server, such as "example.com".
-   Port: This refers to the network port used to connect to the server, such as "80" for HTTP or "443" for HTTPS.

## CORS

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows web resources such as JavaScript to access resources from a different origin than the one that served the original web page. By default, web browsers enforce a same-origin policy that prevents scripts or resources from one origin to access or manipulate resources from a different origin.

CORS works by adding HTTP headers to cross-origin requests and responses. When a web page or script makes a cross-origin request, the web browser sends a preflight request to the server, asking for permission to make the actual request. The preflight request includes the HTTP method, headers, and other metadata of the actual request. The server responds with a set of CORS headers that indicate whether the request is allowed, and if so, which HTTP methods, headers, and origins are allowed to access the resource.

The most common CORS headers are:

-   Access-Control-Allow-Origin: This header specifies the origins that are allowed to access the resource. For example, if the value is set to "\*" (the wildcard character), any origin is allowed. Otherwise, only the specified origin(s) are allowed.
-   Access-Control-Allow-Methods: This header specifies the HTTP methods that are allowed to access the resource. For example, "GET, POST, OPTIONS".
-   Access-Control-Allow-Headers: This header specifies the HTTP headers that are allowed in the actual request. For example, "Content-Type, Authorization".
-   Access-Control-Max-Age: This header specifies how long the browser should cache the preflight response, in seconds.

If the server responds with the appropriate CORS headers, the browser will allow the actual request to be made. Otherwise, the browser will block the request and return an error to the client.
