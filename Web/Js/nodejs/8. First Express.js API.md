## Express

Express is a popular web application framework for Node.js, a server-side JavaScript runtime. It provides a set of features and tools for building web applications, APIs, and microservices. Express is known for its minimalist and flexible design, which allows developers to create web applications with ease and simplicity.

Express provides a number of features, including:

-   Middleware: Express supports middleware, which are functions that can be chained together to process HTTP requests and responses. Middleware can be used for tasks such as parsing request bodies, handling authentication, and logging requests.
-   Routing: Express provides a simple and flexible routing mechanism for defining routes and handling HTTP requests. Routes can be defined based on HTTP methods and URL patterns.
-   Templating engines: Express can work with a variety of templating engines such as EJS, Pug, and Handlebars, allowing developers to render dynamic HTML pages based on data.
-   Error handling: Express provides a robust error handling mechanism for handling errors and exceptions that occur during request processing.
-   Static file serving: Express can serve static files such as images, CSS, and JavaScript files directly from the file system, making it easy to build web applications with client-side components.
-   Third-party middleware: Express has a large ecosystem of third-party middleware that can be easily integrated into an application.


## Middleware

In Express, middleware is a function or a set of functions that are invoked before the final request handler function. Middleware functions can access and modify the request and response objects, and can perform tasks such as logging, authentication, error handling, and so on.

Middleware functions in Express are defined using the `app.use()` method, which takes one or more functions as arguments. These functions are executed in the order they are defined, and each function has access to the `request`, `response`, and `next` objects.

Here is an example of a simple middleware function that logs the HTTP method and URL of each incoming request:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    const start = Date.now()
    console.log("Middleware")
    //before
    next()
    //after
    const end = Date.now()
    const diff = end - start
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url} ${diff}ms`)
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});

```

## Model View Controller

Model-View-Controller (MVC) is a software design pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller.![[2560px-MVC-Process.svg.png]]

## Restful API

A RESTful API is a type of web service that uses HTTP requests to access and manipulate data. The term REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is a design pattern for web services that emphasizes scalability, flexibility, and simplicity.

RESTful APIs are based on a client-server model, where the client sends requests to the server to perform specific actions, such as retrieving data, updating data, or deleting data. The server then responds with a representation of the requested resource, such as a JSON or XML document.

- The formal REST constraints are as follows:
1.  Client-Server: The client and server are separate from each other, and the client sends requests to the server to access resources.
    
2.  Stateless: The server should not store any client state between requests. Each request should contain all the information necessary for the server to process it.
    
3.  Cacheable: The server should indicate which responses are cacheable, allowing clients to reuse responses from previous requests.
    
4.  Uniform Interface: The server should provide a uniform interface for accessing resources, which is typically achieved through HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
    
5.  Layered System: A system can be composed of multiple layers, and each layer should only interact with its adjacent layers.
    
6.  Code on Demand (optional): The server can provide executable code to be executed on the client, allowing for more dynamic and flexible applications.

## CRUD

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the four basic operations that can be performed on persistent storage (such as a database) in most software applications.

## Express Router

In Express, a router is a middleware that can be used to define routes and handle HTTP requests. It provides a way to modularize your application and organize your routes into separate files or modules.

To create a router in Express, you can use the `express.Router()` method:

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Define routes and middleware for the router
router.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is the homepage');
});

router.get('/about', (req, res) => {
  res.send('This is the about page');
});

// Export the router so it can be used in other modules
module.exports = router;

```

```js
const express = require('express');
const router = require('./router');
const app = express();

// Mount the router at the specified path
app.use('/', router);

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');
});
```

Using routers in Express can help you organize your code and make your application more modular. By splitting your routes into separate modules, you can make it easier to maintain and scale your application over time.

## Express static webSite

In web development, a static website consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that are pre-built and served as-is to the client's browser. Express is a popular web framework for Node.js that can be used to serve static websites as well as dynamic web applications.

To serve a static website using Express, you can use the `express.static` middleware, which serves static files from a specified directory:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.static('public'));

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');
});
```

You can also serve static files from multiple directories by passing an array of directory paths to the `express.static` middleware:

```js
app.use(express.static(['public', 'assets']));
```

Using Express to serve static websites can be useful for small projects or for prototyping, as it allows you to quickly set up a web server without needing to configure a more complex stack. However, for larger applications, you may want to consider using a more robust web server, such as NGINX, that is specifically designed for serving static content.

## Express View Engine

In Express, a view engine is a middleware that can be used to render dynamic HTML templates and generate dynamic content on the server side. There are several view engines available for Express, including Pug, EJS, hbs, Handlebars, and more.

for example:

```js
npm install hbs
```

```js
//express view engine

app.set('view engine', 'hbs')
app.set('views', path.join(__dirname, 'views'))
```

```html
//layout.html
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>{{title}}</title>
</head>

<body>
    {{{body}}}
</body>

</html>
```

```hml
//index.html
{{content}}
```

```js
//express view
app.get('/view', (req, res) => {
    res.render('index', {
        title: "My Title",
        content: "Content!"
    })
})
```
