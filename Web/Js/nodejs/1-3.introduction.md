JavaScript is generally considered a `synchronous` programming language, meaning that code is executed in a sequential and blocking manner, and a function will not return until its entire execution is complete. However, Node.js, a popular runtime environment for JavaScript, provides the libuv library to enable asynchronous behavior in JavaScript.

`Libuv` is a C library that provides an event loop and other functionality for handling `asynchronous` I/O operations in Node.js. When a JavaScript function is executed that involves an asynchronous operation, such as reading from a file or making a network request, the function does not block and instead returns immediately. The libuv library takes over and performs `the I/O operation in the background`, and once it is complete, it notifies Node.js, which then invokes the callback function associated with the operation.

This means that, even though JavaScript is still technically a synchronous language, Node.js can leverage libuv to enable asynchronous behavior and non-blocking I/O operations. This allows Node.js to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently and avoid blocking the execution of other code while waiting for I/O operations to complete.

## Event loop phases

In Node.js, the event loop has several phases. Each phase is responsible for handling certain types of operations and callbacks. Understanding the event loop phases is crucial to writing efficient and performant Node.js applications.

The event loop phases in Node.js are:

1.  **Timers**: This phase executes callbacks scheduled by `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` functions.
    
2.  **I/O callbacks**: This phase executes I/O related callbacks such as network I/O, file I/O, and other system operations.
    
3.  **Idle, prepare**: This phase is used internally by Node.js to prepare for the next poll iteration.
    
4.  **Poll**: This phase retrieves new I/O events from the event queue and executes their callbacks. It also handles other types of events, such as `setImmediate()`. If no events are available, it will wait for events to be added to the queue. If the poll phase is idle for too long, it will stop and move to the next phase.
    
5.  **Check**: This phase executes `setImmediate()` callbacks.
    
6.  **Close callbacks**: This phase executes close event callbacks, such as `socket.on('close', ...)`.
    

These phases are executed in a loop, with each iteration being referred to as a "tick." The event loop will continue to run as long as there are events in the event queue, or until it is stopped explicitly. By breaking down the event loop into these distinct phases, Node.js is able to handle I/O operations efficiently and avoid blocking the execution of other code.


## Callback queue

In Node.js, the callback queue is a data structure used by the event loop to manage callbacks that are ready to be executed. When an asynchronous operation such as a network request or file I/O completes, its callback function is added to the callback queue. These callbacks are executed in the next iteration of the event loop, after the current phase has completed.
