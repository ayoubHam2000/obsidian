An algorithm is polynomial if its time complexity is at most $O(n^k)$ where k is a constant. All the above time complexities except $O(2^n)$ and $O(n!)$ are polynomial. In practice, the constant k is usually small, and therefore a polynomial time complexity roughly means that the algorithm is efÔ¨Åcient.
