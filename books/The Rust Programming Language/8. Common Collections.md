- A _vector_ allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
- A _string_ is a collection of characters. We‚Äôve mentioned the `String` type previously, but in this chapter we‚Äôll talk about it in depth.
- A _hash map_ allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It‚Äôs a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a _map_.

## Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

#### Creating a New Vector

```rust
  let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
```

```rust
 let mut v = Vec::new();

    v.push(5);
    v.push(6);
    v.push(7);
    v.push(8);
```

#### Reading Elements of Vectors

```rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &i32 = &v[2];
println!("The third element is {third}");

let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
match third {
	Some(third) => println!("The third element is {third}"),
	None => println!("There is no third element."),
}
```

When we run this code, the first `[]` method will cause the program to panic because it references a nonexistent element. This method is best used when you want your program to crash if there‚Äôs an attempt to access an element past the end of the vector.

When the `get` method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns `None`


Recall the rule that states you can‚Äôt have mutable and immutable references in the same scope. That rule applies in Listing 8-6, where we hold an immutable reference to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end. This program won‚Äôt work if we also try to refer to that element later in the function:

```rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let first = &v[0];

v.push(6);

println!("The first element is: {first}");
```

#### Iterating over the Values in a Vector

```rust
let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &v {
	println!("{i}");
}
```

```rust
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &mut v {
	*i += 50;
}
```

To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the `*` dereference operator to get to the value in `i` before we can use the `+=` operator.

#### Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types

```rust
enum SpreadsheetCell {
	Int(i32),
	Float(f64),
	Text(String),
}

let row = vec![
	SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
	SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
	SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
];
```

#### Vec API

https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html

```rust
let mut vec = Vec::new();
vec.push(1);
vec.push(2);

vec.pop();
vec.len();
vec.extend([1, 2, 3]);

--------------------

let mut vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3];
vec1.push(4);
let vec2 = Vec::from([1, 2, 3, 4]);

```

```rust
let vec = vec![0; 5];
assert_eq!(vec, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);

// The following is equivalent, but potentially slower:
let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(5);
vec.resize(5, 0);
assert_eq!(vec, [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]);
```

Use a `Vec<T>` as an efficient stack:

```rust
let mut stack = Vec::new();

stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);
stack.push(3);

while let Some(top) = stack.pop() {
    // Prints 3, 2, 1
    println!("{top}");
}
```

```rust
//slice

// you can also do it like this:
let u: &[usize] = &v;
// or like this:
let u: &[_] = &v;
```


## Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings

The `String` type, which is provided by Rust‚Äôs standard library rather than coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type. When Rustaceans refer to ‚Äústrings‚Äù in Rust, they might be referring to either the `String` or the string slice `&str` types, not just one of those types. Although this section is largely about `String`, both types are used heavily in Rust‚Äôs standard library, and both `String` and string slices are UTF-8 encoded.

```rust
 let mut s = String::new();
```

Using the `to_string` method to create a `String` from a string literal
```rust
let data = "initial contents";

let s = data.to_string();

// the method also works on a literal directly:
let s = "initial contents".to_string();
```

#### Updating a String

```rust
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");

//The push method takes a single character as a parameter and adds it to the String. 
let mut s = String::from("lo");
s.push('l');
```

#### Concatenation with the + Operator or the format! Macro

```rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
```

he `+` operator uses the `add` method, whose signature looks something like this:
```rust
fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {
```

- The reason we‚Äôre able to use `&s2` in the call to `add` is that the compiler can _coerce_ the `&String` argument into a `&str`.
- Second, we can see in the signature that `add` takes ownership of `self`, because `self` does _not_ have an `&`. This means `s1` in Listing 8-18 will be moved into the `add` call and will no longer be valid after that.

```rust
let s1 = String::from("tic");
let s2 = String::from("tac");
let s3 = String::from("toe");

let s = format!("{s1}-{s2}-{s3}");
```

- The `format!` macro works like `println!`
- `format!` is much easier to read, and the code generated by the `format!` macro uses references so that this call doesn‚Äôt take ownership of any of its parameters.


#### Indexing into Strings

```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let h = s1[0];
```

Rust strings don‚Äôt support indexing. But why not? To answer that question, we need to discuss how Rust stores strings in memory.

- A `String` is a wrapper over a `Vec<u8>`.
- The answer, then, is that to avoid returning an unexpected value and causing bugs that might not be discovered immediately, Rust doesn‚Äôt compile this code at all and prevents misunderstandings early in the development process.

#### Bytes and Scalar Values and Grapheme Clusters! Oh My!

Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to look at strings from Rust‚Äôs perspective: as `bytes`, `scalar values`, and `grapheme clusters` (the closest thing to what we would call _letters_).

If we look at the Hindi word ‚Äú‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‚Äù written in the Devanagari script, it is stored as a vector of `u8` values that looks like this:

```text
[224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,
224, 165, 135]
```

That‚Äôs 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at them as` Unicode scalar values`, which are what Rust‚Äôs `char` type is, those bytes look like this:
```text
['‡§®', '‡§Æ', '‡§∏', '‡•ç', '‡§§', '‡•á']
```
There are six `char` values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters: they‚Äôre diacritics that don‚Äôt make sense on their own. Finally, if we look at them as grapheme clusters, we‚Äôd get what a person would call the four letters that make up the Hindi word:
```text
["‡§®", "‡§Æ", "‡§∏‡•ç", "‡§§‡•á"]
```

#### Slicing Strings

Rather than indexing using `[]` with a single number, you can use `[]` with a range to create a string slice containing particular bytes:
```rust
let hello = "–ó–¥—Ä–∞–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–π—Ç–µ";

let s = &hello[0..4];
```

Here, `s` will be a `&str` that contains the first 4 bytes of the string. Earlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was 2 bytes, which means `s` will be `–ó–¥`.

If we were to try to slice only part of a character‚Äôs bytes with something like `&hello[0..1]`, Rust would panic at runtime in the same way as if an invalid index were accessed in a vector:

#### Methods for Iterating Over Strings

Calling `chars` on ‚Äú–ó–¥‚Äù separates out and returns two values of type `char`, and you can iterate over the result to access each element:
```rust
for c in "–ó–¥".chars() {
    println!("{c}");
}
```
Alternatively, the `bytes` method returns each raw byte, which might be appropriate for your domain:

```rust
for b in "–ó–¥".bytes() {
    println!("{b}");
}
```

#### std::string doc

https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.replace

```rust
let sparkle_heart = vec![240, 159, 146, 150];

// We know these bytes are valid, so we'll use `unwrap()`.
let sparkle_heart = String::from_utf8(sparkle_heart).unwrap();

assert_eq!("üíñ", sparkle_heart);

let bytes = sparkle_heart.into_bytes();

assert_eq!(bytes, [240, 159, 146, 150]);
```

```rust
let s = "hello";
let third_character = s.chars().nth(2);
assert_eq!(third_character, Some('l'));
```

```rust
// The first byte is 104 - the byte value of `'h'`
let s = "hello";
assert_eq!(s.as_bytes()[0], 104);
// or
assert_eq!(s.as_bytes()[0], b'h');
```

```rust
let s = "this is old";

assert_eq!("this is new", s.replace("old", "new"));
assert_eq!("than an old", s.replace("is", "an"));
```

```rust
let s = "\n Hello\tworld\t\n";

assert_eq!("Hello\tworld", s.trim());
```

## Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

let team_name = String::from("Blue");
let score = scores.get(&team_name).copied().unwrap_or(0);

for (key, value) in &scores {
	println!("{key}: {value}");
}
```

#### Hash Maps and Ownership

For types that implement the `Copy` trait, like `i32`, the values are copied into the hash map. For owned values like `String`, the values will be moved and the hash map will be the owner of those values

#### Overwriting a Value

If we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key with a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

#### Adding a Key and Value Only If a Key Isn‚Äôt Present

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);

scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let text = "hello world wonderful world";

let mut map = HashMap::new();

for word in text.split_whitespace() {
	let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
	*count += 1;
}

println!("{:?}", map);
```

#### Hashing Functions

By default, `HashMap` uses a hashing function called _SipHash_ that can provide resistance to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks involving hash tables.
This is not the fastest hashing algorithm available, but the trade-off for better security that comes with the drop in performance is worth it.
If you profile your code and find that the default hash function is too slow for your purposes, you can switch to another function by specifying a different hasher.
A _hasher_ is a type that implements the `BuildHasher` trait. We‚Äôll talk about traits and how to implement them in Chapter 10. You don‚Äôt necessarily have to implement your own hasher from scratch; [crates.io](https://crates.io/) has libraries shared by other Rust users that provide hashers implementing many common hashing algorithms.
