## Defining and Instantiating Structs

```rust
struct User {
    active: bool, //field
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
}
```


```rust
fm main() {
  let mut user1 = User {
    active : true,
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    sign_in_count: 1,
  }

  user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
}
```

#### Creating Instances from Other Instances with Struct Update Syntax

The syntax .. specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.

```rust
fn main() {
    // --snip--

    let user2 = User {
        email: String::from("another@example.com"),
        ..user1
    };
}
```


Note that the struct update syntax uses `=` like an assignment; this is because it moves the data, just as we saw in the `“Variables and Data Interacting with Move”` section. In this example, we can no longer use `user1` as a whole after creating `user2` because the String in the username field of `user1` was moved into `user2`.

#### tuple struct

```rust
struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
struct Point(i32, i32, i32);

fn main() {
    let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
    let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
}
```

#### Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields
You can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called unit-like structs

```rust
struct AlwaysEqual;

fn main() {
    let subject = AlwaysEqual;
}
```


## Example program using struct

Another way to print out a value using the `Debug` format is to use the [`dbg!` macro](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.dbg.html), which takes ownership of an expression (as opposed to `println!`, which takes a reference), prints the file and line number of where that `dbg!` macro call occurs in your code along with the resultant value of that expression, and returns ownership of the value.

Note: Calling the `dbg!` macro prints to the standard error console stream (`stderr`), as opposed to `println!`, which prints to the standard output console stream (`stdout`).

```rust
// Rust does include functionality to print out debugging information, 
// but we have to explicitly opt in to make that functionality available 
// for our struct. To do that, we add the outer attribute #[derive(Debug)]

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let scale = 2;
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: dbg!(30 * scale),
        height: 50,
    };

    //println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1);
    //println!("rect1 is {:#?}", rect1);
    dbg!(&rect1);
}
```


## Method Syntax

Unlike functions, methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object)
The `&self` is actually short for `self: &Self`. 
```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }

    fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
        self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
    }

    //Associated function
    //To call this associated function, we use the :: syntax with the struct name;
    fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
        Self {
            width: size,
            height: size,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    };

    println!(
        "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
        rect1.area()
    );
}
```

Rust automatically adds in `&, &mut, or *` so object matches the signature of the method. In other words, the following are the same:

```rust
p1.distance(&p2);
(&p1).distance(&p2);
```

Each struct is allowed to have multiple `impl` blocks.
