Smart pointers are usually implemented using structs. Unlike an ordinary struct, smart pointers implement the `Deref` and `Drop` traits. The `Deref` trait allows an instance of the smart pointer struct to behave like a reference so you can write your code to work with either references or smart pointers. The `Drop` trait allows you to customize the code that’s run when an instance of the smart pointer goes out of scope.

Given that the smart pointer pattern is a general design pattern used frequently in Rust, this chapter won’t cover every existing smart pointer. Many libraries have their own smart pointers, and you can even write your own. We’ll cover the most common smart pointers in the standard library:

- `Box<T>` for allocating values on the heap
- `Rc<T>`, a reference counting type that enables multiple ownership
- `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>`, accessed through `RefCell<T>`, a type that enforces the borrowing rules at runtime instead of compile time


## Using `Box<T>` to Point to Data on the Heap

The most straightforward smart pointer is a _box_, whose type is written `Box<T>`. Boxes allow you to store data on the heap rather than the stack. What remains on the stack is the pointer to the heap data.

Boxes don’t have performance overhead, other than storing their data on the heap instead of on the stack. But they don’t have many extra capabilities either. You’ll use them most often in these situations:

- When you have a type whose size can’t be known at compile time and you want to use a value of that type in a context that requires an exact size
- When you have a large amount of data and you want to transfer ownership but ensure the data won’t be copied when you do so
- When you want to own a value and you care only that it’s a type that implements a particular trait rather than being of a specific type

#### Using a `Box<T>` to Store Data on the Heap

```rust
fn main() {
    let b = Box::new(5);
    println!("b = {}", b);
}
```

We define the variable `b` to have the value of a `Box` that points to the value `5`, which is allocated on the heap. This program will print `b = 5`; in this case, we can access the data in the box similar to how we would if this data were on the stack. Just like any owned value, when a box goes out of scope, as `b` does at the end of `main`, it will be deallocated. The deallocation happens both for the box (stored on the stack) and the data it points to (stored on the heap).

#### Enabling Recursive Types with Boxes

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, List),
    Nil,
}
```

Note that this code won’t compile yet because the `List` type doesn’t have a known size

```rust
use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Cons(2, Cons(3, Nil)));
}
```

#### Using `Box<T>` to Get a Recursive Type with a Known Size

```text
help: insert some indirection (e.g., a `Box`, `Rc`, or `&`) to make `List` representable
  |
2 |     Cons(i32, Box<List>),
  |               ++++    +
```

In this suggestion, “indirection” means that instead of storing a value directly, we should change the data structure to store the value indirectly by storing a pointer to the value instead.

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let list = Cons(1, Box::new(Cons(2, Box::new(Cons(3, Box::new(Nil))))));
}
```

The `Box<T>` type is a smart pointer because it implements the `Deref` trait, which allows `Box<T>` values to be treated like references. When a `Box<T>` value goes out of scope, the heap data that the box is pointing to is cleaned up as well because of the `Drop` trait implementation. These two traits will be even more important to the functionality provided by the other smart pointer types we’ll discuss in the rest of this chapter.

## Treating Smart Pointers Like Regular References with the Deref Trait

Implementing the `Deref` trait allows you to customize the behavior of the _dereference operator_ `*` (not to be confused with the multiplication or glob operator). By implementing `Deref` in such a way that a smart pointer can be treated like a regular reference, you can write code that operates on references and use that code with smart pointers too.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = &x;

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

#### Using `Box<T> `Like a Reference

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = Box::new(x);

    assert_eq!(5, x);
    assert_eq!(5, *y);
}
```

```rust
struct MyBox<T>(T);

impl<T> MyBox<T> {
    fn new(x: T) -> MyBox<T> {
        MyBox(x)
    }
}
```

#### Treating a Type Like a Reference by Implementing the Deref Trait

```rust
use std::ops::Deref;

impl<T> Deref for MyBox<T> {
    type Target = T;

    fn deref(&self) -> &Self::Target {
        &self.0
    }
}
```

When we entered `*y` in Listing 15-9, behind the scenes Rust actually ran this code:

```rust
*(y.deref())
```

The reason the `deref` method returns a reference to a value, and that the plain dereference outside the parentheses in `*(y.deref())` is still necessary, is to do with the ownership system. If the `deref` method returned the value directly instead of a reference to the value, the value would be moved out of `self`. We don’t want to take ownership of the inner value inside `MyBox<T>` in this case or in most cases where we use the dereference operator.

#### Implicit Deref Coercions with Functions and Methods

_Deref coercion_ converts a reference to a type that implements the `Deref` trait into a reference to another type. For example, deref coercion can convert `&String` to `&str` because `String` implements the `Deref` trait such that it returns `&str`.

```rust
fn hello(name: &str) {
    println!("Hello, {name}!");
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&m);
}
```

Here we’re calling the `hello` function with the argument `&m`, which is a reference to a `MyBox<String>` value. Because we implemented the `Deref` trait on `MyBox<T>` in Listing 15-10, Rust can turn `&MyBox<String>` into `&String` by calling `deref`. The standard library provides an implementation of `Deref` on `String` that returns a string slice, and this is in the API documentation for `Deref`. Rust calls `deref` again to turn the `&String` into `&str`, which matches the `hello` function’s definition.


If Rust didn’t implement deref coercion, we would have to write the code in Listing 15-13 instead of the code in Listing 15-12 to call `hello` with a value of type `&MyBox<String>`.


```rust
fn main() {
    let m = MyBox::new(String::from("Rust"));
    hello(&(*m)[..]);
}
```

The number of times that `Deref::deref` needs to be inserted is resolved at compile time, so there is no runtime penalty for taking advantage of deref coercion!

#### How Deref Coercion Interacts with Mutability

Similar to how you use the `Deref` trait to override the `*` operator on immutable references, you can use the `DerefMut` trait to override the `*` operator on mutable references.

Rust does deref coercion when it finds types and trait implementations in three cases:

- From `&T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>`
- From `&mut T` to `&mut U` when `T: DerefMut<Target=U>`
- From `&mut T` to `&U` when `T: Deref<Target=U>`


## Running Code on Cleanup with the Drop Trait

The second trait important to the smart pointer pattern is `Drop`, which lets you customize what happens when a value is about to go out of scope. You can provide an implementation for the `Drop` trait on any type, and that code can be used to release resources like files or network connections.

```rust
struct CustomSmartPointer {
    data: String,
}

impl Drop for CustomSmartPointer {
    fn drop(&mut self) {
        println!("Dropping CustomSmartPointer with data `{}`!", self.data);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("my stuff"),
    };
    let d = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("other stuff"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointers created.");
}
```

The body of the `drop` function is where you would place any logic that you wanted to run when an instance of your type goes out of scope. We’re printing some text here to demonstrate visually when Rust will call `drop`.

#### Dropping a Value Early with std::mem::drop

Unfortunately, it’s not straightforward to disable the automatic `drop` functionality. Disabling `drop` isn’t usually necessary; the whole point of the `Drop` trait is that it’s taken care of automatically. Occasionally, however, you might want to clean up a value early. One example is when using smart pointers that manage locks: you might want to force the `drop` method that releases the lock so that other code in the same scope can acquire the lock. Rust doesn’t let you call the `Drop` trait’s `drop` method manually; instead you have to call the `std::mem::drop` function provided by the standard library if you want to force a value to be dropped before the end of its scope.

- We can’t disable the automatic insertion of `drop` when a value goes out of scope, and we can’t call the `drop` method explicitly.
- We can’t disable the automatic insertion of `drop` when a value goes out of scope, and we can’t call the `drop` method explicitly.
```rust
fn main() {
    let c = CustomSmartPointer {
        data: String::from("some data"),
    };
    println!("CustomSmartPointer created.");
    drop(c);
    println!("CustomSmartPointer dropped before the end of main.");
}
```


## `Rc<T>`, the Reference Counted Smart Pointer

In the majority of cases, ownership is clear: you know exactly which variable owns a given value. However, there are cases when a single value might have multiple owners. For example, in graph data structures, multiple edges might point to the same node, and that node is conceptually owned by all of the edges that point to it. A node shouldn’t be cleaned up unless it doesn’t have any edges pointing to it and so has no owners.

You have to enable multiple ownership explicitly by using the Rust type `Rc<T>`, which is an abbreviation for _reference counting_. The `Rc<T>` type keeps track of the number of references to a value to determine whether or not the value is still in use. If there are zero references to a value, the value can be cleaned up without any references becoming invalid.

Note that `Rc<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios. When we discuss concurrency in Chapter 16, we’ll cover how to do reference counting in multithreaded programs.

#### Using `Rc<T>` to Share Data

![[trpl15-03.svg]]

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Box<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};

fn main() {
    let a = Cons(5, Box::new(Cons(10, Box::new(Nil))));
    let b = Cons(3, Box::new(a));
    let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a));
}
```

When we compile this code, we get this error

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling cons-list v0.1.0 (file:///projects/cons-list)
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `a`
  --> src/main.rs:11:30
   |
9  |     let a = Cons(5, Box::new(Cons(10, Box::new(Nil))));
   |         - move occurs because `a` has type `List`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
10 |     let b = Cons(3, Box::new(a));
   |                              - value moved here
11 |     let c = Cons(4, Box::new(a));
   |                              ^ value used here after move

For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.
error: could not compile `cons-list` due to previous error
```

The `Cons` variants own the data they hold, so when we create the `b` list, `a` is moved into `b` and `b` owns `a`. Then, when we try to use `a` again when creating `c`, we’re not allowed to because `a` has been moved.

We could change the definition of `Cons` to hold references instead, but then we would have to specify lifetime parameters. By specifying lifetime parameters, we would be specifying that every element in the list will live at least as long as the entire list.

Instead, we’ll change our definition of `List` to use `Rc<T>` in place of `Box<T>`

```rust
enum List {
    Cons(i32, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
}
```

We could have called `a.clone()` rather than `Rc::clone(&a)`, but Rust’s convention is to use `Rc::clone` in this case. The implementation of `Rc::clone` doesn’t make a deep copy of all the data like most types’ implementations of `clone` do. The call to `Rc::clone` only increments the reference count, which doesn’t take much time.

#### Cloning an `Rc<T> `Increases the Reference Count

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, Rc::new(Cons(10, Rc::new(Nil)))));
    println!("count after creating a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    let b = Cons(3, Rc::clone(&a));
    println!("count after creating b = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    {
        let c = Cons(4, Rc::clone(&a));
        println!("count after creating c = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    }
    println!("count after c goes out of scope = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
}
```

```console
$ cargo run
   Compiling cons-list v0.1.0 (file:///projects/cons-list)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.45s
     Running `target/debug/cons-list`
count after creating a = 1
count after creating b = 2
count after creating c = 3
count after c goes out of scope = 2
```

At each point in the program where the reference count changes, we print the reference count, which we get by calling the `Rc::strong_count` function. This function is named `strong_count` rather than `count` because the `Rc<T>` type also has a `weak_count`; we’ll see what `weak_count` is used for in the [“Preventing Reference Cycles: Turning an `Rc<T>` into a `Weak<T>`”](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch15-06-reference-cycles.html#preventing-reference-cycles-turning-an-rct-into-a-weakt) section.

----


Via immutable references, `Rc<T>` allows you to share data between multiple parts of your program for reading only. If `Rc<T>` allowed you to have multiple mutable references too, you might violate one of the borrowing rules discussed in Chapter 4: multiple mutable borrows to the same place can cause data races and inconsistencies. But being able to mutate data is very useful! In the next section, we’ll discuss the interior mutability pattern and the `RefCell<T>` type that you can use in conjunction with an `Rc<T>` to work with this immutability restriction.


## RefCell`<T>` and the Interior Mutability Pattern

Recall the borrowing rules you learned in Chapter 4:

- At any given time, you can have _either_ (but not both) one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

With references and `Box<T>`, the borrowing rules’ invariants are enforced at compile time. With `RefCell<T>`, these invariants are enforced _at runtime_. With references, if you break these rules, you’ll get a compiler error. With `RefCell<T>`, if you break these rules, your program will panic and exit.

Similar to `Rc<T>`, `RefCell<T>` is only for use in single-threaded scenarios and will give you a compile-time error if you try using it in a multithreaded context.

Here is a recap of the reasons to choose `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`, or `RefCell<T>`:

- `Rc<T>` enables multiple owners of the same data; `Box<T>` and `RefCell<T>` have single owners.
- `Box<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at compile time; `Rc<T>` allows only immutable borrows checked at compile time; `RefCell<T>` allows immutable or mutable borrows checked at runtime.
- Because `RefCell<T>` allows mutable borrows checked at runtime, you can mutate the value inside the `RefCell<T>` even when the `RefCell<T>` is immutable.

#### Interior Mutability: A Mutable Borrow to an Immutable Value

`RefCell<T>` doesn’t get around the borrowing rules completely: the borrow checker in the compiler allows this interior mutability, and the borrowing rules are checked at runtime instead. If you violate the rules, you’ll get a `panic!` instead of a compiler error.


```rust
pub trait Messenger {
    fn send(&self, msg: &str);
}
```

```rust
struct MockMessenger {
        sent_messages: Vec<String>,
    }

impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {
            self.sent_messages.push(String::from(message));
        }
    }
    
```

We can’t modify the `MockMessenger` to keep track of the messages, because the `send` method takes an immutable reference to `self`. We also can’t take the suggestion from the error text to use `&mut self` instead, because then the signature of `send` wouldn’t match the signature in the `Messenger` trait

```rust
 struct MockMessenger {
        sent_messages: RefCell<Vec<String>>,
    }

  impl Messenger for MockMessenger {
        fn send(&self, message: &str) {  self.sent_messages.borrow_mut().push(String::from(message));
        }
    }
```

For the implementation of the `send` method, the first parameter is still an immutable borrow of `self`, which matches the trait definition. We call `borrow_mut` on the `RefCell<Vec<String>>` in `self.sent_messages` to get a mutable reference to the value inside the `RefCell<Vec<String>>`, which is the vector. Then we can call `push` on the mutable reference to the vector to keep track of the messages sent during the test.

#### Keeping Track of Borrows at Runtime with RefCell`<T>`

With `RefCell<T>`, we use the `borrow` and `borrow_mut` methods, which are part of the safe API that belongs to `RefCell<T>`. The `borrow` method returns the smart pointer type `Ref<T>`, and `borrow_mut` returns the smart pointer type `RefMut<T>`. Both types implement `Deref`, so we can treat them like regular references.

The `RefCell<T>` keeps track of how many `Ref<T>` and `RefMut<T>` smart pointers are currently active. Every time we call `borrow`, the `RefCell<T>` increases its count of how many immutable borrows are active. When a `Ref<T>` value goes out of scope, the count of immutable borrows goes down by one. Just like the compile-time borrowing rules, `RefCell<T>` lets us have many immutable borrows or one mutable borrow at any point in time.

#### Having Multiple Owners of Mutable Data by Combining Rc`<T>` and RefCell`<T>`

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(Rc<RefCell<i32>>, Rc<List>),
    Nil,
}

use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let value = Rc::new(RefCell::new(5));

    let a = Rc::new(Cons(Rc::clone(&value), Rc::new(Nil)));

    let b = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(3)), Rc::clone(&a));
    let c = Cons(Rc::new(RefCell::new(4)), Rc::clone(&a));

    *value.borrow_mut() += 10;

    println!("a after = {:?}", a);
    println!("b after = {:?}", b);
    println!("c after = {:?}", c);
}
```

## Reference Cycles Can Leak Memory

```rust
use crate::List::{Cons, Nil};
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::Rc;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum List {
    Cons(i32, RefCell<Rc<List>>),
    Nil,
}

impl List {
    fn tail(&self) -> Option<&RefCell<Rc<List>>> {
        match self {
            Cons(_, item) => Some(item),
            Nil => None,
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(Cons(5, RefCell::new(Rc::new(Nil))));

    println!("a initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());

    let b = Rc::new(Cons(10, RefCell::new(Rc::clone(&a))));

    println!("a rc count after b creation = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));
    println!("b initial rc count = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));
    println!("b next item = {:?}", b.tail());

    if let Some(link) = a.tail() {
        *link.borrow_mut() = Rc::clone(&b);
    }

    println!("b rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&b));
    println!("a rc count after changing a = {}", Rc::strong_count(&a));

    // Uncomment the next line to see that we have a cycle;
    // it will overflow the stack
    // println!("a next item = {:?}", a.tail());
}


```

```
a -> b
b -> a
cycle


```

The reference count of the `Rc<List>` instances in both `a` and `b` are 2 after we change the list in `a` to point to `b`. At the end of `main`, Rust drops the variable `b`, which decreases the reference count of the `b` `Rc<List>` instance from 2 to 1. The memory that `Rc<List>` has on the heap won’t be dropped at this point, because its reference count is 1, not 0. Then Rust drops `a`, which decreases the reference count of the `a` `Rc<List>` instance from 2 to 1 as well. This instance’s memory can’t be dropped either, because the other `Rc<List>` instance still refers to it.

#### Preventing Reference Cycles: Turning an Rc`<T>` into a Weak`<T>`

In Rust, memory management is primarily handled through a system of ownership rules, borrowing, and lifetimes, all enforced at compile time by the Rust compiler. This system ensures memory safety without the need for a garbage collector. However, Rust can still have memory leaks caused by reference cycles, which occur when two or more objects reference each other in a way that keeps them alive indefinitely, preventing the Rust memory management system from freeing their memory.

Here's how reference cycles can occur in Rust and lead to memory leaks:

1. **Ownership and Borrowing**: In Rust, each value has a single owner at any given time. Owners can lend out references to their data, but they maintain ownership until they go out of scope. Borrowing rules ensure that references cannot outlive the data they refer to, preventing dangling pointers and memory safety issues.
    
2. **Shared References and `Rc<T>`**: Rust provides a type called `Rc<T>` (Reference Counted) that allows multiple ownership of the same data. `Rc<T>` uses reference counting to track the number of references to a value and automatically deallocates the value when the last reference goes out of scope. This allows for shared ownership without the need for explicit lifetimes.
    
3. **Cyclic References**: When two or more objects have references to each other in a way that forms a cycle, neither object can be dropped because they hold references to each other, thus preventing the reference count from reaching zero. This situation leads to a memory leak because the memory occupied by these objects cannot be deallocated.
    
4. **Weak References and `Weak<T>`**: Rust provides a type called `Weak<T>` that allows for weak references to values owned by `Rc<T>`. Unlike strong references (`Rc<T>`), weak references do not affect the reference count, meaning they do not prevent the value from being deallocated. Weak references are often used to break reference cycles by allowing one part of the cycle to hold weak references to the other parts, breaking the strong reference cycle.



```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;
use std::rc::{Rc, Weak};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    parent: RefCell<Weak<Node>>,
    children: RefCell<Vec<Rc<Node>>>,
}


fn main() {
    let leaf = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 3,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![]),
    });

    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());

    let branch = Rc::new(Node {
        value: 5,
        parent: RefCell::new(Weak::new()),
        children: RefCell::new(vec![Rc::clone(&leaf)]),
    });

    *leaf.parent.borrow_mut() = Rc::downgrade(&branch);

    println!("leaf parent = {:?}", leaf.parent.borrow().upgrade());
}
```

At this point, when we try to get a reference to the parent of `leaf` by using the `upgrade` method, we get a `None` value.

- if i have a reference cycle in rust between A and B, then B goes out of scope the reference count of B will decrease by 1, but not for A, why. I think it should decrease for A because B point to A ?
In Rust, reference counting (via `Rc` or `Arc`) is based on ownership rather than pointing relationships.

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

struct A {
    b: Option<Rc<B>>,
}

struct B {
    a: Option<Rc<A>>,
}

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(A { b: None });
    let b = Rc::new(B { a: Some(a.clone()) });
    // Set the back-references
    match a.as_ref() {
        Some(a_ref) => {
            a_ref.b = Some(b.clone());
        }
        None => panic!("Failed to get a reference to A"),
    }
    match b.as_ref() {
        Some(b_ref) => {
            b_ref.a = Some(a.clone());
        }
        None => panic!("Failed to get a reference to B"),
    }
}

```

In this example, we create two structs `A` and `B`, where `A` contains an optional `Rc<B>` and vice versa. We then create instances of `A` and `B` and establish a circular reference between them.

When an `Rc` is dropped, it only affects the reference count of the data it directly owns. In the case of a reference cycle, each `Rc` holds a strong reference to the other. Dropping `b` will decrease the reference count of the data `b` owns (instance of `B`), but it won't affect the reference count of the data owned by `a`. Similarly, dropping `a` will affect only the reference count of the data owned by `a`.
