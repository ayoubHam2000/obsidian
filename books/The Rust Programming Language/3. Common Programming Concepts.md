## Variables and Mutability

- by default, variables are immutable.
- you can make them mutable by adding `mut` in front of the variable name
- constant vs immutable variable:
	- the type of the value _must_ be annotated in `constant` variable
	- constants may be set only to a constant expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime. 
- shadowing
	- you can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable. Rustaceans say that the first variable is _shadowed_ by the second, which means that the second variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable.
``` rust
fn main() 
{
	const PI : f64 = 3.1415
	let x = 0; //immutable
	let mut y : u32 = 10; //mutable
	let mut y : u64 = 10; //shadowing
	let spaces = "   ";
    let spaces = spaces.len();
}
```

## Data Types

#### integers

|Length|Signed|Unsigned|
|---|---|---|
|8-bit|`i8`|`u8`|
|16-bit|`i16`|`u16`|
|32-bit|`i32`|`u32`|
|64-bit|`i64`|`u64`|
|128-bit|`i128`|`u128`|
|arch|`isize`|`usize`|

- the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the computer your program is running on
- You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table. Note that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix, such as `57u8`, to designate the type. Number literals can also use `_` as a visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which will have the same value as if you had specified `1000`.
- integer types default to `i32`.

#### Floating-Point Types

- Rust’s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64`

#### boolean and charaters

- bool
- char
- Rust’s `char` type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII

#### Compound Types

Rust has two primitive compound types: tuples and arrays: 

##### tuple
```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

- destructuring
```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let (x, y, z) = tup;

    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}
```

- access a tuple element directly
```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);

    let five_hundred = x.0;

    let six_point_four = x.1;

    let one = x.2;
}
```

##### The Array Type

- Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an _array_. Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.
```rust
let months = ["January", "February"];
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let a = [3; 5]; // [3, 3, 3, 3, 3]
let first = a[0];
```


#### Functions

- Rust doesn’t care where you define your functions, only that they’re defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by the caller.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1
}
```

Running this code will print `The value of x is: 6`. But if we place a semicolon at the end of the line containing `x + 1`, changing it from an expression to a statement, we’ll get an error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = plus_one(5);

    println!("The value of x is: {x}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    return x + 1;
}
```


#### Control Flow

##### if

It’s also worth noting that the condition in this code _must_ be a `bool`. If the condition isn’t a `bool`, we’ll get an error.

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

Because `if` is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a `let` statement to assign the outcome to a variable

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };

    println!("The value of number is: {number}");
}
```

##### Loops

- loop, while, for
- The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.
- you can return a value from `loop`
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {result}");
}
```

- Loop Labels to Disambiguate Between Multiple Loops
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut count = 0;
    'counting_up: loop {
        println!("count = {count}");
        let mut remaining = 10;

        loop {
            println!("remaining = {remaining}");
            if remaining == 9 {
                break;
            }
            if count == 2 {
                break 'counting_up;
            }
            remaining -= 1;
        }

        count += 1;
    }
    println!("End count = {count}");
}
```

- while and for
```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    let mut index = 0;

    while index < 5 {
        println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);

        index += 1;
    }
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a {
        println!("the value is: {element}");
    }
}
```
