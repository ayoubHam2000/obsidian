`poll()` is a system call in Unix-like operating systems that monitors multiple file descriptors to see if I/O is possible on any of them. It is similar to the `select()` function, but it is more efficient for large numbers of file descriptors, as it does not require the use of bit masks and can handle a wider range of file descriptor values. The `poll()` function takes an array of structures, each of which specifies the properties of a single file descriptor to be monitored, and returns information about the readiness of the descriptors. The function can be used to monitor sockets, pipes, and other file descriptors for readability, writability, and exceptional conditions.
