`struct timeval` is a data structure defined in the C standard library that is used to represent a time interval. It is used with the `select()` function to specify a timeout period for the function to wait for events on file descriptors.

The `struct timeval` structure contains two fields:

-   `tv_sec`: an integer that represents the number of seconds in the time interval
-   `tv_usec`: an integer that represents the number of microseconds in the time interval
