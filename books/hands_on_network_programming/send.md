`send()` is a function provided by the C standard library that is used to send data to a socket. It is typically used with connection-oriented socket types, such as SOCK_STREAM, which are used for TCP connections.

The `send()` function takes the following arguments:
```C
ssize_t send(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags);
```
-   `sockfd` is the socket descriptor that identifies the socket to send data to.
-   `buf` is a pointer to the buffer containing the data to be sent.
-   `len` is the number of bytes to be sent.
-   `flags` is a bit-mask that can be used to modify the behavior of the function.

The `send()` function returns the number of bytes sent. If the socket is in a non-blocking mode, and the socket buffer is full, the function will return -1 and set the global variable errno to EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK.

Here is an example of how to use the `send()` function to send data to a socket:

```C
#include <sys/socket.h>

int sockfd;
char buffer[1024] = "Hello, World!";
int bytes_sent;

// Send data to the socket
bytes_sent = send(sockfd, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
```

This code sends the data stored in the buffer "Hello, World!" to the socket `sockfd`. The third argument, `sizeof(buffer)` specifies the number of bytes to be sent and the last argument, `0` specifies that no flags are set. The function returns the number of bytes sent, which is stored in the variable `bytes_sent`.

It's important to note that, `send()` is a blocking function, it will block the execution until all the bytes are sent or an error occurs. It is also possible to use `sendto()` function, which is used for sending datagram-oriented protocols like UDP.

//------

In this chapter's TCP server code section, we ignored the possibility that send() could block or be interrupted. In a fully robust application, what we need to do is compare the return value from send() with the number of bytes that we tried to send. If the number of bytes actually sent is less than requested, we should use select() to determine when the socket is ready to accept new data, and then call send() with the remaining data. As you can imagine, this can become a bit complicated when keeping track of multiple sockets.

Chapter 13, Socket Programming Tips and Pitfalls, addresses concerns regarding the send() function's blocking behavior in more detail.
