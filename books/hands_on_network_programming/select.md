In C network programming, the `select()` function is used to monitor multiple file descriptor sources for events or data to read or write. The function takes three sets of file descriptors, one for read, one for write, and one for errors, and waits until one or more of the descriptors is ready for the requested operation. The `select()` function returns the number of ready file descriptors, and the sets are modified to indicate which descriptors are ready.

The syntax for the `select()` function is as follows:

```C
int select(int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, fd_set *exceptfds, struct timeval *timeout);
```

Where:

-   nfds: The highest-numbered file descriptor in any of the three sets, plus 1.
-   readfds: A pointer to a set of file descriptors to be checked for readability.
-   writefds: A pointer to a set of file descriptors to be checked for writability.
-   exceptfds: A pointer to a set of file descriptors to be checked for errors.
-   timeout: A pointer to a `struct timeval` object that specifies how long to wait for an event, or `NULL` to block indefinitely.

For reading data from or writing data to network sockets, you can use the `select()` function to monitor multiple sockets and determine which one is ready for the next operation.

The return value is the number of file descriptors that are ready for the specified operation, or -1 if an error occurs. You should use the `FD_ISSET()` macro to check whether a particular file descriptor is set in the returned sets.

It's important to note that select() is not recommended to be used with high-performance servers, as it has some limitations, it would be better to use other alternatives like epoll, which is more efficient and works well with high-traffic servers.

```C
#include <sys/select.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int sock1, sock2, sock3;
    // Assume that sock1, sock2, and sock3 are valid socket descriptors

    fd_set readset;
    int maxfd;

    // Clear the set
    FD_ZERO(&readset);

    // Add the socket descriptors to the set
    FD_SET(sock1, &readset);
    FD_SET(sock2, &readset);
    FD_SET(sock3, &readset);

    // Get the maximum file descriptor
    maxfd = max(sock1, max(sock2, sock3));

    // Wait for an event on any of the sockets
    int nready = select(maxfd + 1, &readset, NULL, NULL, NULL);

    if (nready > 0) {
        if (FD_ISSET(sock1, &readset)) {
            printf("Socket 1 is ready for reading\n");
        }
        if (FD_ISSET(sock2, &readset)) {
            printf("Socket 2 is ready for reading\n");
        }
        if (FD_ISSET(sock3, &readset)) {
            printf("Socket 3 is ready for reading\n");
        }
    }
    return 0;
