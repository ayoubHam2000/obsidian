The recvfrom() function is a socket API function that is used in network programming to receive data from a network socket. It is commonly used with UDP sockets, but can also be used with other socket types.

The function has the following signature:
```C
ssize_t recvfrom(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags, struct sockaddr *src_addr, socklen_t *addrlen);
```
The first argument, `sockfd`, is the socket file descriptor that represents the socket to receive data from. The second argument, `buf`, is a pointer to a buffer that will be filled with the received data. The third argument, `len`, is the maximum number of bytes that can be received and stored in `buf`. The fourth argument, `flags`, is an optional argument that specifies additional flags for the receive operation. The fifth argument, `src_addr`, is a pointer to a `sockaddr` structure that will be filled with the address of the sender. The sixth argument, `addrlen`, is a pointer to a `socklen_t` variable that specifies the size of the `src_addr` structure, and is used to return the actual size of the address stored in `src_addr`.

The return value of the `recvfrom()` function is the number of bytes received, or -1 if an error occurs.

The `recvfrom()` function is used to receive data from a socket without establishing a full-duplex connection, as is the case with TCP. It is useful for applications that require low overhead and fast, unreliable data transfer, such as real-time multimedia streaming.
