`recv()` is a function provided by the C standard library that is used to receive data from a socket. It is typically used with connection-oriented socket types, such as SOCK_STREAM, which are used for TCP connections.

The `recv()` function takes the following arguments:
```C
ssize_t recv(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);
```

-   `sockfd` is the socket descriptor that identifies the socket to receive data from.
-   `buf` is a pointer to a buffer that will be filled with the received data.
-   `len` is the maximum number of bytes to be received.
-   `flags` is a bit-mask that can be used to modify the behavior of the function.

The `recv()` function returns the number of bytes received. If the socket is in a non-blocking mode, and there is no data available to be received, the function will return -1 and set the global variable errno to EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK.
