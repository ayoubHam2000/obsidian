`recv()` is a function provided by the C standard library that is used to receive data from a socket. It is typically used with connection-oriented socket types, such as SOCK_STREAM, which are used for TCP connections.

The `recv()` function takes the following arguments:
```C
ssize_t recv(int sockfd, void *buf, size_t len, int flags);
```

-   `sockfd` is the socket descriptor that identifies the socket to receive data from.
-   `buf` is a pointer to a buffer that will be filled with the received data.
-   `len` is the maximum number of bytes to be received.
-   `flags` is a bit-mask that can be used to modify the behavior of the function.

The `recv()` function returns the number of bytes received. If the socket is in a non-blocking mode, and there is no data available to be received, the function will return -1 and set the global variable errno to EAGAIN or EWOULDBLOCK.
Here is an example of how to use the `recv()` function to receive data from a socket:
```C
#include <sys/socket.h>

int sockfd;
char buffer[1024];
int bytes_received;

// Receive data from the socket
bytes_received = recv(sockfd, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
```
This code receives data from the socket `sockfd` and stores it in the buffer `buffer`. The third argument, `sizeof(buffer)` specifies the maximum number of bytes to be received and the last argument, `0` specifies that no flags are set. The function returns the number of bytes received, which is stored in the variable `bytes_received`.

It's important to note that, `recv()` is a blocking function, it will block the execution until data is received or an error occurs. It is also possible to use `recvfrom()` function which is used for receiving data from datagram-oriented protocols like UDP.

For a concrete example, imagine we wanted to make our tcp_serve_toupper server terminate if it received the quit command through a TCP socket. You could call send(socket, "quit", 4, 0) on the client and you may think that a call to recv() on the server would return quit. Indeed, in your testing, it is very likely to work that way. However, this behavior is not guaranteed. A call to recv() could just as likely return qui, and a second call to recv() may be required to receive the last t. If that is the case, consider how you would interpret whether a quit command has been received. The straightforward way to do it would be to buffer up data that's received from multiple recv() calls.
We will cover techniques for dealing with recv() buffering in Section 2, An Overview of
Application Layer Protocols, of this book.

For more complicated protocols where this is needed, we have to buffer data from recv() until a suitable amount is available to interpret. For TCP peers that are handling large amounts of data, buffering to send() is also necessary.
