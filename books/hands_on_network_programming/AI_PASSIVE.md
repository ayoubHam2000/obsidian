**AI_PASSIVE** is a constant defined in the POSIX standard and used in network programming to specify the behavior of a socket address when used in a call to the bind() or getsockname() function. When AI_PASSIVE is used as the value of the "flags" argument in a call to the getaddrinfo() function, it indicates that the socket address should be used for bind() and that the socket should listen for incoming connections. In this context, AI_PASSIVE causes the IP address portion of the socket address structure to be set to INADDR_ANY, which means that the socket will listen on all available network interfaces. This can be useful, for example, when a server needs to listen for incoming connections on all available network interfaces.
