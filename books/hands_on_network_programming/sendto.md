The sendto() function is a socket API function that is used in network programming to send data to a network socket. It is commonly used with UDP sockets, but can also be used with other socket types.

The function has the following signature:
```C
ssize_t sendto(int sockfd, const void *buf, size_t len, int flags, const struct sockaddr *dest_addr, socklen_t addrlen);
```
The first argument, `sockfd`, is the socket file descriptor that represents the socket to send data to. The second argument, `buf`, is a pointer to a buffer that contains the data to be sent. The third argument, `len`, is the number of bytes to be sent from `buf`. The fourth argument, `flags`, is an optional argument that specifies additional flags for the send operation. The fifth argument, `dest_addr`, is a pointer to a `sockaddr` structure that specifies the address of the destination socket. The sixth argument, `addrlen`, is the size of the `dest_addr` structure.

The return value of the `sendto()` function is the number of bytes sent, or -1 if an error occurs.

The `sendto()` function is used to send data to a socket without establishing a full-duplex connection, as is the case with TCP. It is useful for applications that require low overhead and fast, unreliable data transfer, such as real-time multimedia streaming.
