`listen()` is a function provided by the C standard library that is used to prepare a socket for accepting incoming connections. It is typically used with connection-oriented socket types, such as SOCK_STREAM, which are used for TCP connections.

The `listen()` function takes the following arguments:
```C
int listen(int sockfd, int backlog);
```
-   `sockfd` is the socket descriptor that identifies the socket to be placed in a listening state.
-   `backlog` is the maximum number of pending connections that can be queued up for the socket.

The `listen()` function is used to create a passive socket, that is, a socket that can be used to accept incoming connections. When a socket is placed in a listening state, it becomes capable of accepting incoming connections. The `backlog` argument specifies the maximum number of pending connections that can be queued up for the socket. Once a socket is in the listening state, you can use the `accept()` function to accept incoming connections.

Here is an example of how to use the `listen()` function to prepare a socket for accepting incoming connections:
```C
#include <sys/socket.h>

int sockfd;

sockfd = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);

listen(sockfd, SOMAXCONN);
```
This code creates a new socket using the `socket()` function, with the AF_INET address family (IPv4), SOCK_STREAM socket type (TCP), and the default protocol (0). Then it places the socket in a listening state using the `listen()` function with a backlog of SOMAXCONN, which is a constant value defined by the system, which is the maximum value allowed.

It is important to note that, the `listen()` is a blocking function, it will block the execution until a connection is received and needs to be called after `
