A problem is NP-hard if an [algorithm](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Algorithm.html) for solving it can be translated into one for solving any [NP-problem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NP-Problem.html) (nondeterministic polynomial time) problem. NP-hard therefore means "at least as hard as any [NP-problem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NP-Problem.html)," although it might, in fact, be harder.

## Notes

- NP-complete problems has the remarkable property that if an efûcient algorithm exists for any one of them, then efûcient algorithms exist for all of them.
- No efficient algo- rithm for an NP-complete problem has ever been found, nobody has ever proven that an efûcient algorithm for one cannot exist.
