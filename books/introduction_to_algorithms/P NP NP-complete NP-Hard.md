A problem is NP-hard if an [algorithm](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Algorithm.html) for solving it can be translated into one for solving any [NP-problem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NP-Problem.html) (nondeterministic polynomial time) problem. NP-hard therefore means "at least as hard as any [NP-problem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NP-Problem.html)," although it might, in fact, be harder.

## Notes

- In theoretical computer science, **a nondeterministic Turing machine (NTM)** is a theoretical model of computation whose governing rules specify more than one possible action when in some given situations.

- A problem is called **NP** ([nondeterministic](https://www.britannica.com/science/NP-problem) polynomial) if its solution can be guessed and verified in polynomial time; nondeterministic means that no particular rule is followed to make the guess. If a problem is NP and all other NP problems are polynomial-time reducible to it, the problem is NP-complete. Thus, finding an efficient [algorithm](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/algorithm) for any NP-complete problem implies that an efficient algorithm can be found for all such problems.
- NP is the set of decision problems _solvable_ in polynomial time by a [nondeterministic Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_Turing_machine "Nondeterministic Turing machine").
- NP is the set of decision problems _verifiable_ in polynomial time by a [deterministic Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_Turing_machine "Deterministic Turing machine").
- NP-complete problems has the remarkable property that if an efficient algorithm exists for any one of them, then efficient algorithms exist for all of them.
- No efficient algorithm for an NP-complete problem has ever been found, nobody has ever proven that an efficient algorithm for one cannot exist.
