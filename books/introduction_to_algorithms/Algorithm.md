 ### What is An Algorithm
 
* Informally, an algorithm is any well-deufined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as `input` and produces some value, or set of values, as `output` in a finite amount of time. An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output.

### instance of a problem

- In general, an `instance of a problem` consists of the input (satisfying whatever constraints are imposed in the problem statement) needed to compute a solution to the problem.

### Correct Algorithm

- An algorithm for a `computational problem` is `correct` if, for every `problem instance` provided as input, it halts  its computing in finite time and outputs the correct solution to the problem instance. A correct algorithm solves the given computational problem. An incorrect algorithm might not halt at all on some input instances, or it might halt with an incorrect answer.

### Data structure

* A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modiuÌ‚cations.

## Notes

- For smaller input merge sort usually can be slower than insertion sort $$(n \approx 44)$$
