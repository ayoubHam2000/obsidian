A Docker volume is a way to store data outside of a Docker container's filesystem. Volumes can be used to persist data, even if the container is deleted or recreated. They allow to separate the data of an application from the container, which can be useful for many reasons. This can include sharing data between containers, storing data on the host's filesystem, or making data available to other processes running on the host.
When you create a volume, it does not exist on the host's filesystem, but it's tracked by the Docker daemon. When a container uses a volume, the Docker daemon will create the volume if it does not exist, and the files in the volume will be visible to the container at the specified mount point.

Docker volumes can be created and managed using the `docker volume` command. You can create a volume using the `docker volume create` command. For example:
```c
docker volume create my-volume
```
When you create a container, you can use the `--mount` or `-v` option to attach a volume to a container's filesystem.
```C
docker run -it --name mycontainer -v my-volume:/app/data myimage
```
This command creates a container named "mycontainer" and mounts the volume "my-volume" to the directory "/app/data" in the container. Any files written to the /app/data directory inside the container will be stored in the "my-volume" volume.
It is important to note that, as soon as you delete a container that uses a volume, the data stored in the volume is not deleted. This is useful when you want to keep data between container restarts. However, if the volume is not used by any container, you can use `docker volume rm` to remove the volume.
 
- there is three type of volumes  `Host Volume`s , `Anonymous Volumes`, `Named Valumes`
	- docker -v `HostVolumePath`:`ContainerVolumePath` ..
	- docker -v `ContainerValumePath` ..
	- docker -v `name`:`ContainerValumePath` ..
